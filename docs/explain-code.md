# Explain code with Duet AI

First, let's see if Duet AI can help us to understand the code.

Open [TodoItemsController.cs](../before/TodoApi/Controllers/TodoItemsController.cs)
in your IDE and ask the following to Duet AI using the Duet AI chat functionality:

**Prompt**
> Can you explain what this class does?

**Answer**
> The TodoItemsController class is a RESTful API controller that provides CRUD operations for the TodoItem entity. The controller inherits from the ControllerBase class, which provides a number of common methods for handling HTTP requests.

> The GetTodoItems() method returns a list of all TodoItems in the database. The GetTodoItem() method returns a single TodoItem by its id. The PutTodoItem() method updates a TodoItem in the database. The PostTodoItem() method creates a new TodoItem in the database. The DeleteTodoItem() method deletes a TodoItem from the database.

> The controller also implements the IActionFilter interface, which allows it to perform custom actions before and after each request. In this case, the controller uses the IActionFilter interface to validate the input parameters for each request and to ensure that the user is authenticated.

> The TodoItemsController class is a good example of how to create a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core. The controller is well-organized and easy to use, and it provides a number of features that make it a good choice for building APIs.

That was pretty good!
